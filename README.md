# CoastalWaveToolbox
MatLAB Packages used to generate videos of waves with MatLAB to demonstrate particle motion within waves. This is mathematically correct when the seafloor is flat. In the image of the video below the seafloor is not level so not a correct model but it does show the changes as the wave approaches the shore.
